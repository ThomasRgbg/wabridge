Bridge between XMPP chat servers and WA. 

Warning: 
- Of course: Use at your own risk (of damage and frustration)
- These are just some scripts, based on yowsup and sleekXMPP.
- A lot is just hardcoded and quick/dirty hacked, but no beautiful python code.
- It scales very bad, I wrote it to be able to talk some family relatives without really participating in WA.
